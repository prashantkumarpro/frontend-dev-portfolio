## HTML Questions  

# **HTML Basics:**  
üîπ **Question 1: What are the different types of HTML elements?**  

üëâ Try to answer in your own words first.
HTML elements define the structure of a webpage. They are mainly categorized into three types: Block-level elements, Inline elements, and Inline-block elements. Block-level elements, like `<div>` and `<p>`, take up the full width and start on a new line.
Inline elements, like <span> and <a>, only take up as much space as necessary and don‚Äôt start on a new line. Inline-block elements, like `<img>` and `<button>`, behave like inline elements but allow setting width and height.

Awesome! 

### **Question 2: What is the difference between `inline`, `block`, and `inline-block` elements?**  
In HTML, elements are categorized into three types based on how they behave in a document: Block-level, Inline, and Inline-block elements.

Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width of their container.
Examples: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<section>`, `<article>`.

Inline elements do not start on a new line and take up only as much space as their content needs.
Examples: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>` .

Inline-block elements behave like inline elements (staying in line with other elements) but allow setting width and height like block elements.
Examples:  `<img>`, `<button>`, <`input>`.

Great! Here's your next question. üòä  

### **Question 3: What is the difference between `<div>` and `<span>` in HTML?**  
In HTML, the <div> tag is a block-level element that takes up the full width of its container, creating a section on a new line. It's typically used to group larger content sections. On the other hand, the <span> tag is an inline element that only takes as much width as necessary and stays inline with surrounding elements. The <div> is used for creating layout structures, while <span> is used for styling small portions of text or inline content without affecting the page layout.

examples:
`<div style="background: lightgray;">This is a div</div>`
`<span style="color: red;">This is a span</span>`

Awesome! 

### **Question 4: What are semantic HTML elements, and why are they important?**
"Semantic HTML elements are HTML tags that carry meaning and help define the structure of a webpage. Examples include `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<nav>`. These elements make websites more accessible, improve SEO, and make the code easier to maintain. Using semantic HTML helps search engines understand the content and improves the overall user experience."

Great!   

### **Question 5: What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?**  
### **HTML vs. HTML5**:

- **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create webpages. It provides the structure for web pages.
  
- **HTML5** is the latest version of HTML. It introduces new features and elements to improve functionality, performance, and mobile responsiveness. Some key differences:
  
  1. **New Elements**:
     - HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<aside>`, which help structure the page better for both users and search engines (SEO).
  
  2. **Multimedia Support**:
     - HTML5 added native support for audio and video using the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements. This eliminates the need for plugins like Flash.
  
  3. **Local Storage**:
     - HTML5 provides local storage and session storage, allowing websites to store data on the user‚Äôs browser, making it possible to create offline apps.
  
  4. **Improved Forms**:
     - HTML5 introduced new input types (like `email`, `date`, `number`, etc.) and form attributes (like `placeholder`, `autofocus`, etc.) to improve user experience and form validation.
  
  5. **Geolocation**:
     - HTML5 introduced geolocation API, which allows websites to access a user's geographical location (with permission).
  
  6. **Canvas and SVG**:
     - HTML5 introduced the `<canvas>` element, allowing dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. It also supports SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) for creating vector-based graphics.

### **In short**:  
HTML5 is an updated version of HTML that enhances multimedia, mobile capabilities, and offers better structure and functionality.

Great!

## CSS Questions  

### **Question 6: What are the different types of CSS?**  
"There are three types of CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS. Inline CSS is written directly inside an HTML tag using the style attribute and is used for small, quick styling changes. Internal CSS is written inside a <style> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document and is used when styling a single page. External CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML using the <link> tag, making it ideal for large projects where styles need to be applied across multiple pages."

## JavaScript Questions  
### What is the difference between `==` and `===`?  
**In JavaScript, `==` (loose equality) and `===` (strict equality) are used for comparison.**  

- **Loose equality (`==`)** compares only values and performs **type coercion**, meaning JavaScript automatically converts one data type to another if necessary.  
  ```js
  let a = 5; 
  let b = "5"; 
  console.log(a == b); // true (string "5" is converted to number 5)
  ```

- **Strict equality (`===`)** compares both values and data types **without performing type coercion**. The data types must be the same for it to return `true`.  
  ```js
  console.log(a === b); // false (number 5 is not the same type as string "5")
  ```

### What is the difference between function declarations and function expressions in JavaScript? 
‚úÖ **"A function declaration uses the `function` keyword and a function name. It is hoisted, meaning it can be called before its declaration in the code."**  

### Example:
```javascript
greet("Prashant"); // Works because of hoisting

function greet(name) {
  return "Good morning, " + name;
}
```
‚úÖ **"A function expression is defined using the `function` keyword, either with a name (named function expression) or without a name (anonymous function expression). It is not hoisted, meaning it cannot be invoked before its declaration in the code."**  

### Example:
```javascript
greet("PK"); // ‚ùå Error: Cannot access 'greet' before initialization

const greet = function (name) {
  return "Good morning, " + name;
};

console.log(greet("PK")); // ‚úÖ Works after declaration
```
Here are examples of **named function expressions** and **anonymous function expressions**:  

### **Named Function Expression:**  
- The function has a name (`greet`).  
- The name can be used for recursion or debugging.  
```javascript
const greet = function greetFunction(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
};

console.log(greet("Prashant")); // ‚úÖ Output: Hello, Prashant
```
Even though the function has a name (`greetFunction`), it can only be accessed via the variable `greet`.

---

### **Anonymous Function Expression:**  
- No function name is provided.  
- It is assigned directly to a variable.  
```javascript
const greet = function (name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
};

console.log(greet("Prashant")); // ‚úÖ Output: Hello, Prashant
```
Since it has no name, it cannot reference itself inside the function (useful for recursion).  
### **When to Use Named vs. Anonymous Function Expressions**  

‚úÖ **Use Named Function Expressions when:**  
1. **Debugging**: If an error occurs, the function name appears in stack traces, making debugging easier.  
2. **Recursion**: If the function needs to call itself inside, a named function expression is required.  
3. **Readability**: Improves code readability by making the function‚Äôs purpose clearer.  

**Example:**  
```javascript
const factorial = function fact(n) {
  if (n === 0) return 1;
  return n * fact(n - 1); // Using the function's own name for recursion
};

console.log(factorial(5)); // ‚úÖ Output: 120
```
Here, `fact(n)` is used to call itself inside the function.

---

‚úÖ **Use Anonymous Function Expressions when:**  
1. **Short-lived functions**: If a function is used immediately and not referenced elsewhere.  
2. **Event handlers & Callbacks**: Common in event listeners, setTimeout, or array methods.  
3. **Arrow Functions**: Modern JavaScript often prefers arrow functions for brevity.  

**Example (Event Listener):**  
```javascript
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
});
```
Here, the function doesn't need a name because it's just handling an event.

---

üìå **Best Practice:**  
- Use **named functions** for better debugging and recursion.  
- Use **anonymous functions** for simple one-time use cases like event handlers or callbacks.  


### Key Differences from Function Declarations:
- Function expressions are **not hoisted**.
- Can be **anonymous** (without a function name).
- Usually assigned to a variable.
